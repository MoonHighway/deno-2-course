In this video, we use the deno.json file to manage dependencies and configurations in your Deno projects. Learn how to create and configure tasks like 'start' and 'format' to streamline your workflow. We'll also explore customizing formatting and linting rules, and understand the concept of import maps for cleaner imports. Then we'll take a look at compatibility between Deno's deno.json and Node's package.json for seamless project integration.
