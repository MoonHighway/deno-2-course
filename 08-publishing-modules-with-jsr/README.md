In this episode, we look at JSR (the JavaScript Registry), a modern registry optimized for TypeScript and ES modules. Learn how JSR extends the npm ecosystem to support various runtimes like Deno, Bun, and Cloudflare Workers. Follow along as we demonstrate searching for and integrating with the Oak HTTP library, and then publish a custom package. We walk through the entire process from setup, installation, to publishing, and provide tips for ensuring your package is well-documented and consumable by other developers.
