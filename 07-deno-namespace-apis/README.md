In this video, we explore the powerful APIs provided by Deno in the global namespace. We demonstrate file system operations like creating, reading, writing, and appending to files using Deno's built-in methods. Then, examine how to handle command line arguments, environment variables, and set up a basic server. Reduce the need for external APIs with these Deno built-in APIs.
