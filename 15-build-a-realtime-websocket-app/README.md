In this episode, we introduce WebSockets for real-time data communication. Using Deno's WebStandard API, we walk through the process of developing a WebSocket server and client. We explore upgrading HTTP connections to WebSockets, handling events such as 'open', 'message', and 'close'. This tutorial covers everything needed to build a web application that uses WebSockets for efficient real-time data transfer.
